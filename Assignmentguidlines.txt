Create a input field and put ngModel for that element.
Then using ngDoCheck hook, check if that text length is more than three,
then show message (length is greater than 3)

Make basic service call using ngOnInit which is important
to display that view (show user list)

Notes:

Using Angular CLI. So use ng serve to run app on localhost:4200
